Controller version 2.8 by Anruaag Narang

Functionality:
- set function generator defaults on startup
- process and entire command
- Simulate setting of function generator parameters (voltage, frequency, start frequency, stop frequency, hold, interval, scale)
- Simualte frequency sweep (linear and logarithmic)

Changelog:
- Fixed issue where level 2 leaf commands (voltage and wavetype) resulted in errors.
	This was due to midNode string in Menu class not being reset after level 3 leaf command (e.g. frequency)
	was carried out, which is problamatic since VOLTage and WAVEtype nodes are only valid if midNode is " " (default).
