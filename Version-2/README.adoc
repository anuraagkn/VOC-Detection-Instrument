Controller version 2.0 by Anruaag Narang

Functionality:
- read the root of a command and set the corresponding root node
- return error if command is terminated prematurely

Changes from version 1:
'Proper' SCPI command handling - while v1 processes SCPI commands successfully, 
				it also allows for invalid commands to be implemented succesfully
