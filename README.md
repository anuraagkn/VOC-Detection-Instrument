# Instrument Controller

This repo contains source code for the back-end (and soon front-end) of a laboratory instrument controller. The back-end controller takes SCPI commands as input, then decodes and implements them in the instrument circuit.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

* Arduino IDE with SPI library. See https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be
1. Save 'Controller.ino' in a folder named 'Controller'.
2. Save the folders 'CommandHandler', 'Menu' and 'Source' in the library directory of your Arduino IDE installation.
3. Open 'Controller.ino' in the Arduino IDE and load the sketch onto your Arduino board.

## Usage

Command the instrument using the Serial Monitor. Parameters can be set or queried. Example:

```
:SOURce:FREQuency:STARt 5000
```

sets the source frequency, and the start frequency of the sweep to 5000Hz.

```
:SOURce:FREQuency:STARt?
```
Returns the source frequency.
